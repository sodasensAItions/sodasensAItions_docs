# Sprint 1 (Sprint Lead: Adam Sinclair)

Sprint 1 took place over the period of 2 weeks, with the first week focusing on the production of a High-Level Design Document, which would outline the overall structure of the application we would be building. The second week saw us produce the Low-Level Design Document, a document which would contain that which was in our High-Level Design Document, but in a state of much higher granularity.

## High-Level Design Document

During the production of the High-Level Design Document, our team managed to have 2 different meetings overall. Aligning everyone’s schedules was a difficult task, as each person’s schedule often did not allow for meetings to be attended by every team member.

During this time, the team members did the following:

Fardeen

- Fardeen learned how to use Figma and created several UI designs for the different facets of our application. These are included in the design document along with his explanations as to why the UI is designed such. It is important to note that the group collectively decided on where items would go in the application; Fardeen had the task of writing these down and creating the UI designs visually in Figma.

Tyler Cummings

- Tyler Cummings became familiar with the platform and created a prototype model of the AI for the drink generation process. This model makes use of a miniscule data set of 50 drinks that have already been "ordered" by customers and uses these to predict three different types of drinks: good, okay, and bad.

Tyler Allen

- Tyler Allen did research into the drinks AI and the implementation of the GANs algorithm. He also wrote the AI portions of the design document, and laid out a skeleton for the other parts of the document for people to fill in.

Jacob Atkinson

- Jacob Atkinson helped write the section of the high-level design on the backend server component as well as the admin client.

Jakob Herk

- Jakob Herk also worked on the high-level design of the backend server and the admin client. Both Jacob and Jakob worked together on these sections.

Adam Sinclair

- Adam Sinclair researched React and its feasibility in the project. React was seen as unfit for this relatively short project, as it requires in-depth knowledge of both Android and iOS development. Instead, the team decided collectively to use Android. Adam worked on the Customer Client in the High-Level design document, detailing parts of the application, such as the Menu, Custom Drinks, Cart, and Payment.

## Low-Level Design Document

During the production of the Low-Level Design Document, the team managed to have two meetings, and both were highly successful and effective in bringing about a well-developed Low-Level document. Within these meetings, we discussed the requirements for such a documentation and gave feedback on the current progress of each team member's section. We also discussed the Low-Level Design itself in detail, and howe each part would form together to become on whole.

We also split our team into groups, with each group focusing on a specific part of the application, as follows:

1. Artificial Intelligence
    1. Tyler Cummings
    2. Tyler Allen
2. Backend
    1. Jacob Atkinson
    2. Jakob Herk
3. Frontend
    1. Fardeen
    2. Adam Sinclair

Each one of us communicated often with our associated team member to produce our portion of the low-level design document. As we went about its creation, we communicated with members of the other "teams" to produce a low-level design that fit.

Meeting: October 4th, 2:30PM to 3:30PM 
Attendees: Jakob Herk, Jacob Atkinson, Adam Sinclair, Fardeen

Our first meeting was on October the 4th from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM. In this meeting we discussed how to write the low-level design document. We discussed what the differences between the low-level design document and the high-level design document would entail. We concluded that the high-level design document detailed the functionality of the application, and the low-level design document details how this functionality will be implemented from a technological perspective.

We then split into our own teams and went about creating our writing our low-level documentation.

Meeting: October 7th, 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM 
Attendees: Adam Sinclair, Jacob Atkinson, Jakob Herk

The second meeting we had was on October the 7th, from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM. This was a final meeting for finishing our document to discuss any details that would be required for the completion of our respective sections. For example, in this meeting Jakob and Jacob taught me how the registration and login would work from the server side, so that I might be able to detail in my portion of the documentation how login and registration requests might be sent and handled.
