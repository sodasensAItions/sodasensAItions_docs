# Sprint 5 Summary

## Meeting Minutes  
Due to the Thanksgiving break, the team held informal stand-ups after class. A one-hour meeting was conducted in the library the week prior.  

## Tasks Worked On  
The team worked on multiple tasks to enhance both the backend and frontend functionalities of the project. One of the key accomplishments was implementing a feature to ensure users stay signed in after closing the app, improving user experience and convenience.  

Significant progress was made on the backend with the development of API endpoints, including the "Create Order" and "I am here" endpoints. Additionally, functionality to store and retrieve order history from the server was successfully implemented, enabling better data management and accessibility.  

The team also focused on documentation and testing. A draft of the user manual was created to guide users in navigating the application, and a detailed testing document was started to formalize the testing process. While most tasks were completed, the testing document remains a work in progress and will be finalized in the next sprint.  

## Rejected Tasks  
No tasks were rejected.  

## Disposition of Incomplete Tasks  
An initial plan to store saved drinks on the frontend was reevaluated, and the team decided to transition this functionality to server-side storage for greater efficiency and scalability. Consequently, the original task was dropped.
