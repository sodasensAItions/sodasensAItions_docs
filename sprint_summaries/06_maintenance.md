# Sprint 06 Summary

## Meetings

**Monday December 2nd**: This meeting was an overall retrospective of the last
development sprints and a distribution of all the remaining tasks to complete our
project before our presentation on Friday.

**Thursday December 5th**: This meeting was a group programming, problem solving
meeting. We spent about three hours at the meeting debugging the connections from
frontend to backend. We were able to fix some authentication problems and some
problems with the data returned from the backend API endpoints.

## Tasks

We were able to accomplish a huge amount in this final sprint. We were able to
pull together pretty much all of the connections from the frontend to the backend,
implement a few more endpoints on the backend (mainly having to do with saving past orders).

We also were able to finish up a lot of our documentation. We wrote our user manual
and finished up our testing reflections. We also made our final presentation slides.

## General Notes

This sprint is where it really all came together and we got everything more or less
working. It was pretty satisfying to see the demo work as well as it did.
