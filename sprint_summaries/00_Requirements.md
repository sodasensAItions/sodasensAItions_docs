**Sprint \#0 Report**  
**Requirements Analysis**  
The past sprint I would say was done successfully. We all came to an agreement of what we want to do and how we want it to look like. It was not the most efficient but we made sure to get things done.  
Everyone played their part well I would say, we split the requirements doc workload equally after meeting up and discussing the MoSCoW analysis so that we were clear of our direction. 

Adam Sinclair was incharge of the Functional Requirements which he had some issues at first understanding what exactly it is but after meeting up halfway through and going through the document he got a better idea and was able to get it done by the final meetup.

Jakob Herk did the Non-Functional Requirements, he has a lot of previous experiences working on documents and projects so he had a lot of useful inputs on the documentation as well as the project as a whole.

Tyler Cummings did the Business Requirements. He did a pretty good job at it especially since we had not discussed too much in detail of the business requirements during our meetups, and using what vague idea we had he made a well written business requirement document.

Jacob Atkinson did the User Requirements, since most of the user requirements were mentioned in the moscow analysis, he didn't have much to do. However he carried his weight when it came to dealing with GitLab and GitHub since the others were not as well versed in it as him.

Tyler Allen was in charge of the MoSCoW Analysis. We had already gone through roughly what we wanted where and he was incharge of writing it out and as the week passed by we were making changes, like adding some or removing some requirements which he was in charge of keeping track of.

Finally, me, Fardeen, i did the Use Case Stories and Use Case Diagrams. I had to take up the use case diagram last minute because Sarah was dropping the class and had not done anything. I would say I did a good job as well with the use cases, i didnt have much of an idea with the diagrams and was skeptical but upon review by the rest of the team, everything seemed to be okay.
