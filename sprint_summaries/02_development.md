# Sprint 02 Summary

## Meetings

**Monday October 14**: This was an in-class meeting, we mostly worked on our individual
tasks, but we were able to coordinate on some of the data gathering for training
our AI model as well as to get our backlog in order for the next couple of sprints.

**Wednesday October 16**: We met in the library for this meeting, we started to run
into some issues with our AI model spitting out only one drink after it learned
that the particular combination was rated well. We were able to start the Android
Studio project as well as troubleshoot some issues that we were having with the backend.

## Tasks

The Tylers worked together on training and researching about the AI, they made a
lot of progress in this area but eventually ran into some roadblocks due to the
algorithm/model we were using. The next sprint will hopefully allow us to come up with
an alternative.

Jakob and Jacob worked on the backend. Jakob got the whole authentication set up and
Jacob learned how Java Spring works more or less. Jacob got one endpoint partially set up,
then Jakob had to help me realize that the URL was wrong causing a 403 because of it.

Fardeen and Adam both worked on the frontend, they got the login page and the
home page set up and the Android Studio project all set up.

## General Notes

This sprint was really hard for our team, Jakob was out for almost all of it and
the rest of us had stressful midterms and fall break in the middle of it. We managed
to at least get a pretty good direction and learn a lot about the next steps that we
will need to be taking though.
